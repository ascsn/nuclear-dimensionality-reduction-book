# Reduced Basis Methods in Nuclear Physics

This repository holds the source files for the tutorial book found [here!](https://kylegodbey.github.io/nuclear-rbm/landing.html)

The book is a living, breathing document that hosts some simple examples of the reduced basis method applied to problems that are more familiar to nuclear physicists. Please visit the above link for a more comprehensive introduction and to explore some of the examples!
