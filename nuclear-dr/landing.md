# Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction in Nuclear Physics

Welcome to our introduction to dimensionality reduction approaches in nuclear physics! This is a community driven effort and we accept contributions from all interested parties. If you have a problem in nuclear physics that you think is a good highlight for this online book, please reach out. A good source of inspirations for challenges that could become part of the book can be found [here](https://github.com/ascsn/2023-FRIB-TA-Summer-School/tree/main/dimensionality-reduction).

A list of contributors can be found [here](contributors.md).
